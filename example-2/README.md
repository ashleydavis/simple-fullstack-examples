# Example-2

Same as Example-1, but this one adds Nodemon for live reload.

Please read the REAMDE from Example-1 so you know the basics of setup and running it.

## Live reload

When you run this example in "live reload" mode the HTTP server will automatically reload when ever you change the code:

```bash
npm run start:dev
````

This is a really nice way to make a fast development process. 

You should try "diffing" Example-1 to Example-2 to see the changes.
