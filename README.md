# simple-fullstack-examples

Minimal examples of Node.js fullstack applications. 

This is to show that, at least in principal "fullstack" isn't that difficult.

## Setup

You need Node.js installed to try out these examples.

Please download or clone this repo. Then see the README.md in each sub-diretory to learn how to run each example.

## Examples

This repo includes the following examples:

- example-1: Absolute minimal example. A HTTP server that contains a basic static web server that serves up a basic HTML5 web page.

## Coming soon:

Please stay tuned, more examples will added to this repo soon!

- example-2: Introduces Nodemon for live reload.
- example-3: Introduces a REST API that returns some JSON data that's displayed in the front end.
- example-4: Introduces a MongoDB database to stored the data returned by the REST API.
- example-5: Introduces a very basic React front end. This is now a fullstack MERN application! (even though it doesn't actually do anything).
