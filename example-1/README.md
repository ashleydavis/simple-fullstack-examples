# Example-1

Simplest possible "fullstack" application.

It's literally just a static HTTP server that's serving a minimal frontend.

## Setup

Open a terminal, change directory into the repo and invoke these commands:

```bash
cd example-1
npm install
```

## Run it

After setup, invoke this command to start the HTTP server:

``bash
npm start
```

Now point your web browser at:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Have fun exploring the code!
